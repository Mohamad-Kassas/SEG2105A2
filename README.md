Assignment 2, SEG 2105
This is the repository containing the OCSF framework and simple chat application modified according to the assignment instrutcions

Important Note:  
I used Eclipse to set up the project, then VScode to program the additional features and testing the code. To add arguments to the run function already built-in vscode, I used the launch.json file in the .vscode folder. Under the required file section, simply add "args": "arguments"
